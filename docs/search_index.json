You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. "],

Interpret what both tell you. You may also want to include state median values/IQR to help describe the patterns you see.) 2.2.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic (Example code below. The echo and message parameters below keeps the code itself out of the document.) (Example code for maps below. Note that here the spatial data files needs to be loaded in a chunk with “include=FALSE” to surpress the loading message.) 2.2.2 Median household income 2.2.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree 2.3 Models (Include models for both years and scatterplots/fit lines. Interpret the coefficients and measures of model strength, focusing on direction, magnitude, and significance. Also look at the model residuals using density plots and maps as shown in the assignment.) 2.3.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic (Example code below for % Hispanic.) (You can use stargazer to summarise both models.) Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) hisp_pct 0.648* 0.532*** (0.347) (0.200) Constant 50.676*** 42.552*** (1.586) (1.911) Observations 105 94 R2 0.033 0.072 Adjusted R2 0.023 0.062 Residual Std.

(Does error in the residuals appear geographically and staistically random?) 2.3.2 Median household income 2.3.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree 2.3.4 Multivariate models (Run the model with your combined variables here and show results for each year using stargazer as shown above. Compare results to your indivdual models. Check for multicollinearity using VIF and a correlation matrix if necessary. Use the BP test to check for heteroskedasticity.) 2.4 Summary (What did this analysis tell you about the research questions: the relationship between your variables and voting patterns and changes in this relationship across time periods?)
