In this research project, students in UGA’s Introduction to Spatial Analysis joined in this conversation by conducting an analysis of regional voting trends at the district level and their association with changing demographic patterns. Our primary question was the association of race, household income, and education with partisan voting patterns (more specifically, percent voting Demogratic). We also looked at historical trends by running our analysis for two election cycles: 1992 and 2016. Through our analysis, we hoped to better identify the link between these demographic predictors and historical voting patterns. 1.2 Data 1.2.1 Voting We manually digitized voting data in the 1992 and 2016 elections for the U.S. House based on official voting records. We used percentage voting Democratic as our outcome variable, although percentage voting Republican would work equally as well. Some races were uncontested, and for these we adopted the values used in recent research on the efficiency gap: 66% of the vote if the seat was won by a Democrat and 36% if won by a Republican (Stephanopoulos and McGhee, 2015, p. 867). 1.2.2 Demographics District boundaries were downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System database for 1992 and 2016 (Manson, et al. 2017). Not all data was available at voting precinct level in 1992, and so we used the mean values of tract level data to create our variables of interest in both years: % not classified as white, non-Hispanic, % with a Bachelor’s degree or higher, and median household income. These values were based on the 1990 decennial census and 2011-2015 American Community Survey (the most recent at the time of analysis). 1.3 Analysis Each group was assigned one of four census regions. Within each region, group members each did a descriptive analysis of each independent variable individually along with a simple univariate OLS regression. As a group, we also created a multivariate OLS model with all independent variables, evaluating the model results and checking for heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and problems related to model residuals. The results of this analysis are summarized in the sections below. 1.4 References Manson, S., Schroeder, J., Van Riper, D., and Ruggles, S.

["northeast.html", "Chapter 2 Northeast 2.1 Overview 2.2 Descriptive Analysis 2.3 Models 2.4 Summary", " Chapter 2 Northeast 2.1 Overview The Northeast region of the United States includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The number of congressional seats for these states ranged from 1 to 31 in 1990 with New York having the highest and Vermont the lowest. In 2015, the range of congressional seats decreased to 1 to 27. Five states lost congressional seats from 1990 to 2015. The partisan landscape for the northeastern U.S. has largely leaned Democratic. Of these states, only Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Vermont had higher percentages of Republican voters in 1990. While in 2015, only Connecticut and New Jersey were dominated by Republican voters. 2.2 Descriptive Analysis 2.2.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.8084 3.0713 6.0933 16.5257 12.7728 98.3121 ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 3.458 9.881 21.183 28.760 30.178 98.761 In congressional districts in the Northeast Region, percent non-white population has been significantly increased between 1990 and 2015, although most values exhibits values lower than 40%. First, significant increases in the percent non-white population were identified from mean and median values for last 15 years. By simply comparing the values, % of non-white population were positively distributed in both 1990 and 2015. However, the highest peaks were shifted to the higher values from 1990 to 2015; mean values were shifted from 16.53 to 28.76 and median values were 6.10 to 21.18. From histogram analysis, we can analyze where these shifts are attributed. We can find the kurtosis has been significantly changed between 1990 and 2015. In 1990, about 60% of districts in this region exhibited less than 10% of non-white population, but in 2015, values were shifted to higher range and the highest peak was diminished by more than half. In other words, the percent non-white population in both 1990 and 2015 follow Poisson distributions of low lambda values. However, the intensity between 0-10% in 1990 has been decreased and the peak were shifted and alleviated to 0-30% range in 2015. Specifically, all of districts in the northeastern states exhibit similar trends to regional analysis, experiencing significant increase in percent non-white population. Among them, districts in New Jersey experienced the highest increase in percent non-white population with 37.69%, followed by New York with 29.06%. Meanwhile, districts in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont did not changed much in the percent of non-white population, with small increase around 3 or 4 percent. Ridge plots of 1990 and 2015 reveal additional information that changes in higher ranges played significant role in increased mean and median values as well as supporting the abovementioned trends. In 2015, several districts in New York and New Jersey transformed into non-white population dominant districts with more than 70 or 80%. Likewise, Connecticut and Maine in 2015 have some districts with more than 40% of non-white population which did not exist in 1990. 2.2.2 Median Household Income ## ## &lt;table style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1990 Medium Household Income Summary Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/caption&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Statistic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mean&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Median&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Min&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Max&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;St. Dev.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;districts_1990.medhhinc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;62,504.840&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;58,867.500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25,937.060&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;107,859.200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17,357.080&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; ## ## &lt;table style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015 Medium Household Income Summary Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/caption&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Statistic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mean&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Median&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Min&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Max&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;St. Dev.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;districts_2015.medhhinc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;63,251.250&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;61,136.500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25,100.000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;106,917.000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17,544.940&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; ## &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; The median income for congressional districts in the northeastern United States have not exhibited much change in overall magnitude and range between 1990 and 2015. The range of median income for 1990 was $25,937 to $107,859 while the range for 2015 was $25,100 to $106,917. Median income across the districts for 1990 was positively skewed which could be inferred through the comparison of the mean and median values, $65,505 and $58,867 respectively. This was confirmed in the histogram plot of median income frequency with a right-side tail and in the Q-Q plot with a tail deviating from the Q-Q line at the bottom left of the graph. Median income across the districts for 2015 appeared somewhat more normally distributed. The mean and median were very similar, $63,251 and $61,136 respectively. However, plotting the Q-Q plot still showed some skewness in the positive direction. Likewise, in the histogram plot of median income frequency, there appeared to be more districts exhibiting median income in the $40,000 to $70,000 range; a shift toward the right from 1990. It appears that median income levels were increasing slightly. There was an increase in the number of districts with median income in the $60,000 to $70,000 range and a decrease in the $30,000 to $40,000 range. These changes were subtle and could be explained in some part to the variation in sample size between the two years: 1990 with 88 districts and 2015 with 78 districts. Using the ridge plots, comparisons could be made of median income at the state level. Similar trends seen at the region level were seen for individual states. States in 2015 exhibited broader platykurtic peaks in median income with less pronounced multimodality. For example, New Jersey in 1990 showed three strong peaks in median income at approximately $50,000, $70,000, and $85,000 where in 2015 they had flattened out. Another example, Connecticut, in 1990, exhibited strong leptokurtic kurtosis but by 2015 and had a more mesokurtic form. Median income mapped at the district level showed more clearly the spatial changes that occurred between 1990 and 2015. In 2015, more districts fell in the $50,000 to $75,000 class which reflected the increase in median income seen in the previous statistical graphics and measurements. New York districts, in 1990, were predominantly classified as $25,000 to $50,000 while, in 2015, the state became more than fifty percent classified as $50,000 to $75,000. Another interesting trend was seen in Connecticut where a migration of higher income moved east, away from New York City. Similarly, there is a shift of higher income moving away from New York City in New Jersey to the southwest. 2.2.3 Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree The ridge plots demonstrate that there is a shift in the mean to higher percentages from 1990 to 2015 in the Northeast Region. The overall range of the ridge plots from 1990 to 2015 shift to larger percentages with the 2015 plots having districts with as high as 75% of the population having a BA degree or higher. The ridge plots for New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have a similar shape with a main peak in lower percentages, but a few smaller peaks in higher percentages. Comparing CT’s ridge plots from 1990 to 2015, the pattern of the curve stays the same however, there is a shift in the values towards higher percentages. New York has the largest range in percentages with some districts having almost 0% of the people with BA degrees or higher to 75% of the people having BA degrees or higher. The spatial distribution map shows a similar pattern to the ridge plots, overall there is an increase in the percentage of people who have a Bachelor’s degree from 1990 to 2015, however in southwestern PA there appears to be no change to the percentage of people with a Bachelor’s degree. The largest percentages of people with a BA degree in 2015 are located in Northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, southern Connecticut, and eastern Massachusetts. 2.3 Models 2.3.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) nonwht_pct 0.264*** 0.432*** (0.058) (0.050) Constant 42.781*** 42.185*** (1.792) (1.930) Observations 88 78 R2 0.195 0.500 Adjusted R2 0.186 0.493 Residual Std.

According to the results, linear regression results follow heteroskedasticity in plotting two variables, more significantly for the result of 1990. Since districts with low percent non-white populations show extremely wide-ranging percent voting democrat, it is hard to draw meaningful analysis from this range due to the residuals. In addition, more than half of districts in Northeast region are of the low percent non-white population which lead to deteriorate the power of model (e.g. R-squared value). Despite these weaknesses, the percent non-white population in congressional districts tend to exhibit positive relation to percent voting democrat overall; as 1% of non-white population increases, the percent of people who vote Democrat increases by .26% in 1990 and .43% in 2015. P-values for both regression results were less than 0.01 that explain high significance of the results. Adjusted R-squared values, which refer to the explanation power, are estimated as .186 for 1990 and .493 for 2015 indicating that 18.6% and 49.3% of data are explained by linear regression model. One noticeable point from the linear regression models is that the result for 2015 is highly improved than 1990. The reason behind the improvement can be attributed to the shift of the percent non-white population. When we see scatter plots from two models, the most noteworthy difference is that the points ranged from 0 to 10% in x-axis and 0 to 80% in y-axis in 1990 shifted to 0-30% in x-axis and 25-70% in y-axis in 2015. The change in distribution resulted in reduced residuals of linear regression and increased model significance. 2.3.2 Median Household Income Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) medhhinc -0.0003*** -0.0001 (0.0001) (0.0001) Constant 65.881*** 63.848*** (5.994) (6.832) Observations 88 78 R2 0.109 0.025 Adjusted R2 0.099 0.012 Residual Std.

Two linear models were made, one for 1990 and one for 2015. Both models appeared to show little correlation in median income and percent voting democrat. The model for 1990 had an R2 value of 0.109, meaning median income described 10.9% of the variation seen in percent voting democrat across districts. The 2015 model received an R2 of 0.025, describing even less variation than the 1990 model. The direction of both coefficients suggested that there was a negative correlation between median income and percent voting democrat. However, only the coefficient for the 1990 model showed significance at the 0.05 level. The 2016 model coefficient received a p-value of 0.164. 2.3.3 Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct -0.483** 0.193 (0.206) (0.167) Constant 56.286*** 48.614*** (4.217) (5.491) Observations 88 78 R2 0.060 0.017 Adjusted R2 0.049 0.004 Residual Std.

This value is statistically significant based on the p value. When examining the power of the the adjusted R2 value is very low indicating that the regression line does not fit well with the data. In addition, The F statistic is significant indicating the ability to reject the null hypothesis, so this model is better than one with only the intercept. The scatterplot for the 1992 model, shows a slight decrease in democratic voting percentage as BA degree percentage increases, it appears there is a possible high outlier on this plot. Although the model output indicates that the regression line is not a good fit for the data, the scatter plot’s regression line divides the data well as to display a normal distribution of the residuals. There is a shift when analyzing the results for the 2016 model output. For every percent increase in people with a Bachelor’s degree, the percentage of voting democratic increased by .193, this value is not as large as the 1992 model and is also not statistically significant. When examining the power of the 2016 model, the adjusted R2 is even lower than the 1992 model, so this regression line does not fit the data well. The F Statistic is not statistically significant, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected indicating that this model is no better than a model with just the intercept. Although the scatter plot displays the regression line that shows a slight increase in percentage democratic vote as percentage BA degree increases, there does not appear to be a clear linear pattern in the data as well as quite a few outliers. 2.3.4 Multivariate Models Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) nonwht_pct 0.225*** 0.401*** (0.060) (0.047) medhhinc -0.0002 -0.0004*** (0.0001) (0.0001) badeg_pct 0.087 0.747*** (0.291) (0.179) Constant 55.602*** 43.293*** (6.332) (5.092) Observations 88 78 R2 0.236 0.595 Adjusted R2 0.209 0.578 Residual Std.

Overall, the multivariate model fits the data better than the individual models as indicated by the larger adjusted R2 value. Although, the multivariate model is better than the individual models, two of the three variables coefficients (median household income and percent with BA degree) are not statistically significant. Both the percent BA degree and the non-white percent coefficients result in an increase in the percent voting democratic. Based on the results of the VIF, multicollinearity is not an issue because all of the values are less the 5 referring that three variables are independent each other. In addition, heteroskedasticity is an issue based on the statistically significant results of the BP test, so the null hypothesis that the data is not heteroskedastic can be rejected. The density plots of the residuals indicate that the data is approximately normally distributed, which is important because when this assumption is met the results of the model can be trusted more accurately. Examining the spatial distribution of the residuals, the model overestimated the percent democratic vote in most of New York and Vermont, as well as some districts in northwestern PA, northern NJ, and western CT. The model underestimated the democratic voting percentage in districts in southwestern PA, most of Rhode Island, eastern MA, most of NH, and southern ME. The 2016 multivariate model results indicate that this model is more powerful not only than a model made up of only the intercept based on the results of the F test as well as more powerful than the univariate models. In addition, the multivariate model fits the data much better than the 2016 univariate models and the 1992 multivariate model based on the larger adjusted R2 value. Unlike the 1992 multivariate model, all of the coefficients of the 2016 model are statistically significant. As with the 1992 results, an increase in both the non-white percent variable and the BA degree percent result in an increase in the percent voting democratic. Similar to the 1992 results, multicollinearity is not an issue in this case due to the VIF values being lower than 5. Unlike the 1992 results, heteroskedasticity is not an issue because the p value is not statistically significant based on the BP test, so the null hypothesis that the data is not heteroskedastic cannot be rejected. Based on the density plots, it appears that the residuals are normally distributed, which meets the assumption necessary for trusting the results of the models. Examining the residuals spatial distribution, the model overestimates the voting percentage in northern and central NJ, much of NY, while the largest areas of underestimates are located in VT, MA, eastern CT, and RI. 2.4 Summary The multivariate model was a stronger predictor of democratic voting than individual univariate models. The variables in the 2016 model explain more of the variation seen percent democratic voting than in 1992. Race and education level appear to be defining party lines more through time in the Northeast. There have been changes in the geographic distribution of these variables. In 1992, the Northeast region was predominantly white. As time goes on, the non-white percent population increases and spreads, emanating from population centers, i.e. New York City. The demographic distribution has had a greater influence on the percent voting democratic. The variables percent non-white and median household income both doubled in strength between 1992 and 2016, though their directions are opposite. The percent BA degree or higher became significant and an influential factor in predicting democratic voting through time. Based on our results, the voting patterns of 2016 in the Northeast were more influenced by the variables studied here than 1992. The models indicate that other variables may have affected the voting patterns in 1992, therefore it could be beneficial to include different contributors to better understand the democratic vote in 1992.

["south.html", "Chapter 3 South 3.1 Overview 3.2 Descriptive analysis 3.3 Models 3.4 Summary", " Chapter 3 South 3.1 Overview The U.S. Census Bureau defines the “South Region” as including the following sixteen states: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. This project investigates voting tendencies of U.S. citizens living within congressional voting districts of the South Region in the elections of 1992 and 2016. Voting districts are represented by one member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The number of voting districts in each state is determined through the “apportionment” process. This process divides the total 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives between states based on the proportion of the general population each state contains (as defined by the decennial census report). Therefore, a state’s population (and changes in population) directly influences the number of districts (and House Representatives) the state be assigned. Between the elections of 1992 and 2016 a major party shift occurred in the South Region, swinging the majority of voters from Democratic to Republican. The South Region contained 145 congressional districts in 1992. These districts were split between states as follows: Alabama (7), Arkansas (4), Delaware (1), Florida (22), Georgia (11), Kentucky (6), Louisiana (3), Maryland (8), Mississippi (5), North Carolina (12), Oklahoma (6), South Carolina (6), Tennessee (9), Texas (30), Virginia (11), and West Virginia (3).The population of the South region increased between the 1990 and 2015 census. As of 2015, the region’s total number of congressional districts had increased by 15 to 160. States that increased in number of districts were: Florida (+4), Georgia (+3), Louisiana (+3), North Carolina (+1), South Carolina (+1), and Texas (+6). Only Mississippi and Oklahoma decreased in number of congressional districts (-1 and -2, respectively). All other states in the South Region did not change. During the 1992 election, the mean percentage of citizens in the South Region who voted Democrat was 53.84% (IQR=23.38). This shows that voters of the South Region, in general were more likely to vote Democrat than Republican in 1992. The distributions of the percentage of population voting Democrat by State were fairly platykurtic and some even bimodal. This shows that in 1992 there was variation in how districts would vote inside of individual states (some districts leaning Democrat, some GOP). Still, 86 of the 145 districts had a mean percentage of Democratic voters greater than 50 %. There was not a stark geographic pattern to the voting habits of citizens in 1992. The mean percentage of the South Region’s citizens who voted Democrat in the 2016 election had decreased by more than 13% to 40.43% (IQR=30.1275). This displays that, today, voters in the South Region are highly likely to vote Republican. In 2016, only 47 of the 160 voting districts had a mean percentage of Democratic voters greater than 50 %. The distributions of the districts’ Democratic percentage, by state, had shifted to the left (decreased) and become more leptokurtic (less variance around the state mean). A geographic pattern also begins to emerge, based on the 2016 election. Rural districts are far more likely to vote Republican than Democrat, while districts containing mostly Urban areas lean toward Democrats. 3.2 Descriptive analysis 3.2.1 Percent not White The ridgeplot above displays the distributions of the percentages of the population who identified as “non-White”, by state, in both the 1990 and 2015 census. The red line represents the regional mean for each year, while blue represents the 50 percent line. The 1990 ridgeplot displays that the majority of districts in the South Region had a non-White population less than that of the year’s regional mean (26.65% in 1990). It also shows that the majority of the regions population identified as “White, non-Hispanic”. The data show that in 1990, The majority of districts in each state had a majority White population, but that only 15.86 % of districts (23 of 145) had majority non-White populations. The 2015 ridgeplot shows the increase in mean non-White population (to 38.88% in 2015), as most state histograms shifted to the right. Even more interesting is the fact that there are more districts with majority non-White populations. This number increased to 38 of 160 (23.75%) districts. In both census years, Whites are the majority race in the South Region. The data show that the non-White population in the South Region increased by more than 10 percent (26.65% in 1990 to 38.88% in 2015) between 1990 and 2015. All states show positive skew, showing that all states contain certain districts with a much higher percentage of non-White populations. The above maps show the spatial distribution of non-White population percentage in the South Region. Some geographic patterns stand out in these maps. The influence of change in both African-American and Hispanic populations are visible in these maps. Areas of high non-White population are visible in Southern Texas, and areas of South Florida. Areas of high non-White population are also visible across districts of the “Cotton belt”. From 1990 to 2015, non-White population percentages increased in most of the South districts, but a major increase can be seen in South Florida. The districts on the Western side of South Florida increased from having low non-White populations (&lt;30%) to high (&gt;70%). The only areas of the South Region where we don’t see much change is in Arkansas, Western Tennessee, Kentucky, and the mountainous regions of Appalachia. 3.2.2 Median household income The ridge plot shows that the mean of the median household income variable, indicated by the red line on each plot, did not change much between 1990 and 2015 in the South region, consistently staying just below $50,000. While the mean for median household income increased across the region in 2015, the distributions of household income between districts in each state stayed primarily less than $50,000, with more states appearing to have more of a bell curve shape in the ridge plots. In 1990, the voting districts of West Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama have a smaller distribution of median household income that are primarily below the mean of $44,897.65. This indicates that there is less variation in median household income between districts, so wealth may not be a primary factor in the creation of district boundaries. For the rest of the region, there is a larger discrepancy between the median household incomes that illustrates a noticeable difference in the wealth of voting districts. The most extreme examples are Virginia and Maryland, where the median household incomes range from below $50,000 to almost $100,000 across districts. In 2015, there were not any drastic changes amongst the voting districts, only a minor increase in the mean of state median houshold incomes at $47,727.17. Overall, the median household income was higher for most states with the exception of Mississippi, Kentucky, Florida, Arkansas and Alabama. Once again, Virginia and Maryland remained outliers with larger discrepancies in median household income across voting districts. Virginia has a larger distribution of median household incomes than in 1990, but Maryland experienced a slight decrease in the range of median household income between districts. Natural break intervals were used for the maps to illustrate the small differences between 1990 and 2015 for median household income. The natural breaks show the slight variation in the overall pattern of median household incomes, confirming the slight increase in the mean and overall distribution amongst voting districts observed in the ridgeplots. In 2015, the 11 of the 16 states in the South region had a median between $40,000 and $50,000, resulting in the mean of $47,727.17. The 2015 map shows some of these changes through the change in the natural breaks, with an increase in the intervals between $40,000 and $50,000. The 1990 and 2015 maps both indicate that median household income is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, particularly around Houston, Atlanta, and the area surrounding Washington D.C. 3.2.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree Every state in the South Region experienced a rise in its median percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree from 1990 to 2015. The median percentage of the South Region overall increased from 11.6% to 20.4%. On the ridgeplots for both 1990 and 2015 we can see that the mean (red line) is ahead of the median (blue line) indicating there are some positive outliers contributing to positive skewness. States in 2015 exhibit slightly more variability (IQR = 11.6) in bachelor’s degree percentage than in 1990 (IQR = 7.6). In 1990, the states of Virginia, Texas, Maryland, North Carolina, and Georgia have some strong positive outliers while the other states stay closer to the median. In 2015, there is more variation. Looking at the map, it is clear that districts near or in urban areas have higher rates of bachelor’s degrees. The metropolises of Atlanta, Dallas, Washington D.C., and others, are evident due to their high rates in 1990 and 2015 relative to surrounding districts. Bachelor’s degree percentages in the districts of 2015 are higher than in the districts of 1990. 3.3 Models 3.3.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic Model results pct 1992 2016 (1) (2) nonwht_pct 0.223*** 0.504*** (0.044) (0.039) Constant 47.765*** 24.384*** (1.604) (1.765) Observations 145 160 R2 0.151 0.509 Adjusted R2 0.145 0.506 Residual Std.

The above scatterplot shows that, in 1990 and 2015, the percent of a district’s population that is non-White is positively correlated with the percent of the population who voted Democrat in the next election. While both 1990 and 2015 show positive relationships between % non-White and % voting Democratic, the magnitude of this relationship increased during that time frame. Our 1992 univariate regression model found that for every 1% increase in district’s non-White population, the % voting Democrat was highly likely (significance p&lt;.01) to rise by 0.219 %. Only 14.5% of the variance in the Percent Democratic variable was explained by the percentage of non-White citizens (adjusted r squared=0.145), showing that this variable was not the primary driver of a district’s voting tendencies. The election of 2016 showed a very different story. Our 2016 model shows that for every 1% increase in a district’s percentage of non-White population, the percentage of that district voting Democrat would increase by a half of a percent. This finding was highly significant (p&lt;.01) with an R squared value of 0.5. This means that in the 2016 election, HALF of the variance in the percent voting Democrat within a district could be explained simply by the percentage of the district’s citizens who were not White. 3.3.2 Median household income (You can use stargazer to summarise both models.)

The scatterplots show that in 1990, the median household income is negatively correlated with the percent of the population who voted Democrat, while in 2015 there is a slight positive correlation. Although the scatterplots indicate a change in direction, the magnitude of this relationship between percent voting democrat and median household income decreased between 1990 and 2015. The R squared for the univariate model is stronger for 1990 than 2015 but both of these relationships are fairly weak. In 1990, the median household income only explained 16% of the variance in the model, while in 2015, it explained only 0.2% of the variance. The scatterplots confirm the weak correlation, or lack thereof, as the line of best fit hardly passes through the majority of the data points for median household income. 3.3.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct -0.621*** 0.224** (0.141) (0.111) Constant 62.428*** 38.516*** (2.303) (2.923) Observations 145 160 R2 0.120 0.025 Adjusted R2 0.114 0.019 Residual Std.

In 1992, there is a strong negative relationship between bachelor degree percentage and percent democratic adjusted. The r-squared of the 1992 model tells us that 11.3% of the variation found within the data is explained by the model. In 2016, there is a weak positive relationship between bachelor degree percentage and percent democratic adjusted. The r-squared of the 2016 model tells us that 2.5% of the variation found within the data is explained by the model. In 1992, bachelor degree percentage served as a better indicator of voting habits then in 2016, however, the r-squared was still very low and therefore explains very little variance. From 1992 to 2016, having a bachelor’s degree becomes more likely to predict that you are voting democratic. From 1992 to 2016, the univariate model shows that percent bachelor’s degree changes from being negatively associated with voting democratic to positively associated. The percent of bachelor’s degrees increased in all districts from 1992 to 2016. 3.3.4 Multivariate models ## nonwht_pct medhhinc badeg_pct ## 1.085552 4.387013 4.219876 ## nonwht_pct medhhinc badeg_pct ## 1.003520 3.847536 3.846453 ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: model_se_1990 ## BP = 4.1239, df = 3, p-value = 0.2484 ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: model_se_2015 ## BP = 12.303, df = 3, p-value = 0.006414 Model results pct 1992 2016 (1) (2) nonwht_pct 0.172*** 0.501*** (0.043) (0.039) medhhinc -0.0004** -0.0001 (0.0002) (0.0001) badeg_pct 0.002 0.331** (0.268) (0.151) Constant 65.684*** 21.964*** (5.123) (3.794) Observations 145 160 R2 0.256 0.534 Adjusted R2 0.241 0.525 Residual Std.

The adjusted r-squared value for the regression is 0.24, meaning only 24% of the variance in “% Democrat vote” could be explained by the districts % non-White population, median household income, and % with a bachelor’s degree. The model found that while a district’s racial composition and median income explained some variance in the percentage of the district who voted democrat, these variables were not the primary drivers of political leanings of the South Region. The coefficients for both “% non-White”(0.172, p&lt;.01) and median household income (-0.0004, p&lt;.05) were found to be significant, but the finding for the percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree or higher (0.002, p&gt;0.1) was insignificant. This tells us that a district’s education level had no real effect on it’s voting tendencies in the 1992 election (p&gt;0.05). The 2016 multivariate model was able to explain more than half of the variance in voting tendencies within South Region districts (adj. r-squared of 0.53). The percent non-White variable is responsible for the vast majority of the model’s power to explain variance. In 2016, the model showed that for every percent increase in a district’s non-White population, the district’s expected percentage of Democratic voters increases by a half a percent (0.501, p&lt;.01). A household’s median income was found to no longer be a significant indicator of political leaning (-0.0001, p&gt;0.1).In the 2016 election, having a bachelor’s degree is significantly tied to voting democratic (0.331, p&lt;0.05). Both multivariate models were tested for multicollinearity, normality of residuals, and heteroskedasticity. All variables had a VIF score less than 5, telling us that our chosen independent variables did not co-vary with one another. The residuals of both models were normally distributed, as seen in the plot, histograms, and Shapiro-Wilk test results (both p&gt;.05). The normal distribution of these model residuals shows that model error was randomly distributed among the data, and therefore not a problem to the models. There was also no noticeable spatial pattern in the distribution of these residuals. The 2015 model did display heteroskedasticity. With all tests considered, the model results are dependable. 3.4 Summary Southern districts with higher percentages of non-White citizens tend to have lower median household incomes, and lower percentages of citizens possessing a bachelor’s degree or higher. These facts were true in both the 1992 and 2016 election cycles. We found that the percentage of a district’s population who would vote Democrat (in the South Region) was influenced the most by the percentage of that population who were not White. This fact held true in both election cycles. Party leanings of districts in the South Region were less racially charged in 1992 than in 2016. In 1992, the percentage of citizens possessing a college education also influence the percentage that vote Democrat. This changed in the 2016 election, as this variable no longer was able to explain much variance in the dependent variable (% Democrat). Median household income of districts in the South Region did not serve as a good indicator of a district’s political leaning in either election. The most important finding of this study is that the political leanings of districts in the South Region seem to have become far more racially charged from the 1992 election to that of 2016. While the independent variable “percent non-White” explained only 14.5% of the variance in “percent voting Democrat” in 1992, this number increased to 50%. In the same time frame, the expected increase in the percentage of Democratic voters (per 1% increase in non-White population) in a district went from 0.172% to .501%. This displays a massive increase in the influence Southern districts’ racial compositions have on political leaning. "],
["midwest.html", "Chapter 4 Midwest 4.1 Overview 4.2 Descriptive analysis 4.3 Models 4.4 Summary", " Chapter 4 Midwest By Ian Boatman, Emily Pauline, and Matthew Warren 4.1 Overview This chapter will focus on the Midwest region. This region consists of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. In 1990, each state had the following number of congressional districts: North Dakota: 1 South Dakota: 1 Nebraska: 3 Kansas: 4 Missouri: 9 Iowa: 5 Minnesota: 8 Wisconsin: 9 Illinois: 20 Indiana: 10 Michigan: 16 Ohio: 19 In 2016, each state had the following number of congressional districts: Northa Dakota: 1 South Dakota: 1 Nebraska: 3 Kansas: 4 Missouiri: 8 Iowa: 4 Minnesota: 8 Wisconsin: 8 Illinois: 18 Indiana: 9 Michigan: 14 Ohio: 16 Overall, the entire region experienced a decrease in number of congressional districts. This is due to the redistricting that occurs with each census. The population of the midwest decreased between these two elections, so the number of congressional districts also decreased. Each state usually displays the following general voting tendencies: North Dakota: Republican South Dakota: Republican Nebraska: Republican Kansas: Republican Missouri: Republican Iowa: swing Minnesota: Democratic Wisconsin: Democratic, although it went Republican in the 2016 presidential election Illinois: Democratic Indiana: Republican Michigan: Democratic, although it went Republican in the 2016 presidential election Ohio: swing) 4.2 Descriptive analysis 4.2.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic (Ian Boatman) In the ggridges plot, we see how the average non-white, non-Hispanic people voted Democratic in each of the Midwestern states. The left plot shows the spread in the 1992 presidential election, while the right plot shows the spread in the 2016 presidential election. In the 1992 spread, we see that the peaks from each state are very narrow, meaning that there isn’t much spread in the data. We see this in a more obvious manner in the left tmap above. The 1992 election, referenced in the left tmap above, doesn’t include much spread of the data because very few non-white, non-Hispanic people live in those areas. In the left ggridges plot, we see that all of the peaks come right before the red line, which represents the average amount of non-white, non-Hispanic people that lived in all of those states combined. The right ggridges plot shows data from the 2016 presidential election. The peaks are generally a bit wider here, meaning that there is more spread of the data relative to the previous 1992 election. We see more obviously in the right tmap of the non-white, non-Hispanic variable. The color table has a wider distribution to it. Now, we see pockets where the percentage non-white, non-Hispanic people are heavily concentrated, such as the Chicago area in northeastern Illinois. This should tell us that this particular population has expanded and grown since the early 1990s. While the peaks of the 2016 averages do not touch the red line in the right graph of the ggridges output, we see that some of the data comes in closer contact with this average, like Kansas and Nebraska. We see these differences more clearly in the second tmap above, where southern Kansas and eastern Nebraska have more of a gradient. 4.2.2 Median household income (Matthew Warren) For the median household income ridge plots for the Midwestern region, one can observe variations from state to state. The red line acts as an indication for the overall average of the entire dataset for the midwest.Between 1990 and 2015, the average overall median income is fairly similar, just north of $50,000. Wisconsin is on par with the regional average at $50,000 and is normally distributed except for a slight negative skew in both years. Ohio is normally distributed in both years and has an average similar to the regional average in 1990, but is significantly below the regional average in 2015. North Dakota and South Dakota do not have ridge plots as they only have one district each. This means there is no fluctuation within the state form median household income. For North Dakota, from 1990 to 2015, that number changes from $38,535 to $55,480, a massive increase. From 1990 to 2015, South Dakota’s median household income changes from $38,426 to $50,212. Nebraska is normally distributed and is very similar to the regional average in 2015, whereas it is far below the Midwest average in 1990. Missouri is below the regional average in median household income in both 1990 and 2015 at around $35,000-$40,000. It is normally distributed for the most part except for an outlying postive skew, likely related to St. Louis and Kansas City. Minnesota is skewed to the right and above the regional average for median household income in both 1990 and 2015. Michigan is slightly skewed to the right and slightly above the regional average in 1990, however in 2015 it is normally distributed and below the regional average. In both years the median household income for Kansas is negatively skewed and slightly below the regional average. In both 1990 and 2015, Indiana is slightly below the regional average. In 1990 it is normally distributed whereas in 2015 it is slightly negatively skewed. For Iowa, both years are normally distributed, but 1990 is well below the regional average as opposed to 2015, where it is very similar to the regional average. Illinois definitely has the most abnormal distribution of the states. It’s distribution seems slightly skewed to the left for both years and is above the regional average median household income for both. However there are several outliers. The difference between the districts is by far the largest, only comparable to Missouri and Michigan. The difference is smaller in 2015, but in 1990 the median household income fluctuated from around $25,000 to near $125,000. Each state is unique in how median household income is represented spatially. For instance, one must consider the number of congressional districts each state possesses. There is a great disparity between the median household income of rural areas vs urban areas. For this analysis, the range starts from 0-$35,000 to account for low income areas. It then grows by $5,000 increments all the way to $70,000. Then the map accounts for the wealthiest areas beyond $70,000. The map also shows the redistricting of states from 1990 to 2015. From 1990 to 2015, North and South Dakota’s one congressional district each account for the median household income of the entire state. In 1990 both states had a significantly low median household income, but that has since change as the 2015 map shows a large increase. Nebraska’s three districts show an gradual increase in median household income from rural areas to urban areas such as Omaha. The state gradually from 1990 to 2015 is closer to the regional average. Kansas is just like Nebraska except with a few more districts and the main urban area being just outside of Kansas City near the Missouri border. Missouri’s districts have lower median household incomes than much of the rest of the Midwest in both 1990 and 2015, except for in the area around St. Louis, which is significantly higher than the rest of the state. According to the map, Iowa is fairly homogenous in regard to median household income spatially, and a little below the regional average. Minnesota has a great disparity between the lower median household incomes of rural counties in the western part of the state as opposed to very wealthy counties in the east towards the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Wisconsin and Illinois, similarly have a large flux from the western rural counties to the large cities of Madison-Milwaukee and Chicago respectively. Illinois specifically has some of the richest and some of the poorest counties in the entire Midwest region. Indiana is fairly middle of the road on average compared to the rest of the Midwest. Indianapolis is missing from the dataset, but one can assume it would follow the trend of the rest of the region as having a greater than average median household income. Michigan and Ohio both confirm the trends previously observed in the Midwest. In both 1990 and 2015, the rural areas have significanly lower average median household incomes than urban areas. The most obvious urban areas where this takes place are Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. 4.2.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree (Emily Pauline) Analysing the ridge plots and maps below, we can begin to understand the distribution of the percent of the Midwest population that held a Bachelor’s Degree in the elections of both 1992 and 2016. We will first begin with the ridge plots. Plotted here is the density of the population that had a Bachelor’s degree, broken down by congressional districts in each state. The vertical red line represents the median value of the percent of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree. In the 1990 election, the number is somewhere around 14%. This means that for the entire Midwest region, after comparing all congresisonal districts, the middle value for the percent of people with a Bachelor’s Degree was 14%. Looking at the spikes in the ridge plots supports this number. Ridge plots plot the number of times a certain number was reported. The ridges with the highest peak represent the number that was reported the most. In the case of each state in the Midwest during the 1990 election, the majority of the peak values for each state were between 10-20%. This means that within each congressional district of the Midwest, it was most common that 10-20% of the population had a Bacheor’s Degree. There are a few states with secondary maxima in ridge heights. Nebraska, Missouri, Minnesota, Kansas, and Illinois all have secondary maxima between the 20-30% group. This means that there were more congressional districts in these states that had higher percentages of the population that had Bachelor’s Degrees. Within Illinois and Minnesota, there were a few congressional districts that reported percentages even higher than this; Minnesota had a few districts report that 35% of the population had a bachelor’s degree, and 50% of a couple districts in Illinois had a Bachelor’s Degree. Moving forward to 2016, we can see that the numbers change a little bit. Overall, the median value of the percent of the Midwest with a Bachelor’s Degree increases from about 15% in 1992, to about 22%! This new percentage is also supported by peaks seen in the ridges. In contrast to 1992, 2016 had a larger spread of average percentages reported, so peaks are not as tall, and there is a greater spread of values across each state. Peak values of the percent of the population that had a Bachelor’s Degree for each state range from 10-40%. Overall, this shows that there was an increase of Midwest residents that received Bachelor’s degrees. Illinois and Minnesota continue to be the states that have the highest percentages of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree reported. There are now a few districts in Illinois where about 50% of the population had a Bachelor’s Degree, and a few districts in Minnesota saw a pretty large jump in the percent of people with Bachelor’s Degrees. One secondary maxima is at 40%, and another is at 55%! Between these two elections, Minnesota experienced a large increase in the percent of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree. Looking at the maps provides a useful tool to see the spatial distribution of these reported percentages. We can use them to identify the specific districts of each of the maxima. In the map from 1990, we can see that the district in Minnesota that reported that about 40% of it’s population had a Bachelor’s Degree is located in the east-central part of the state, close to Minneapolis. In Illinois, the districts that reported the highest percentages of the population that had a Bachelor’s degree are located in the northeast part of the state, within the Chicagoland area. This can also be seen in the map from 2016. The maxima in Illinois and Minnesota are still very pronounced, but now there are other maxima visible in Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Similar to 1990, the maxima in all of these states occur in areas of the state that are in close proximity to major cities, like St. Louis or Indianapolis. From this, we can see that in general the highest concentrations of people with Bachelor’s degrees are generally found close to larger cities. 4.3 Models 4.3.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic (Ian Boatman) Model results Pct.

In the model above, the coefficients in both years are positive (0.395 in 1992, and 0.551 in 2016), and have a decent magnitude to them. This variable plays a significant role. We see that over time, as the percentage of non-white, non-Hispanic people increases, the likelihood of that district voting Democratic in an election also increases. The r-squared value for 1992 is 28%, which means that 28% of the variance in districts voting Democratic can be explained by the percent non-white, non-Hispanic variable. This means that this particular variable is pretty significant in explaining how districts vote. The r-squared value increases to 59.9% in the 2016 presidential election, meaning that 59.9% of the variance in districts voting Democratic can be explained by the percent non-white, non-Hispanic variable. The 1992 election linear regression model, as represented by the left scatterplot above, shows that in general, districts get more Democratic as the percentage of non-white, non-Hispanic people increases. However, there are a few outliers. This could probably be atttributed to those states who don’t have high populations in their districts, such as North Dakota. The scatterplot on the right, which is from the 2016 presidential election, seems to be much more uniform, which lines up with the coefficients and r-squared values previously mentioned. The dots line up better with the linear model line, meaning that there is more certainty that how districts vote Democratic in an election depends on the percent non-white, non-Hispanic variable. 4.3.2 Median household income (Matthew Warren) Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) medhhinc -0.0004*** -0.0003** (0.0001) (0.0001) Constant 74.539*** 62.797*** (5.747) (7.579) Observations 105 94 R2 0.139 0.058 Adjusted R2 0.131 0.048 Residual Std.

This shows that the median household income has virtually no impact on the percentage of district residents voting for a democratic candidate. This is honestly the lowest magnitude I have ever seen using a regression model in R. A negative coefficient suggests the direction of the model is negative as both -0.0004 and -0.0003 are negative figures. However, these numbers are so low that there is virtually no direction at all. The significance is shown using the “*&quot; for each. These are “***&quot; for 1990 and “**&quot; for 2015 respectively. This shows that the relationship to the p-values garners the findings of the model very significant. The r square values are low for both 1990 and 2015. For 1990 the r-squared value is 0.139 and for 2015 it is 0.058. This shows that the model does not explain the variability of democratic voters. The scatterplot confirms the findings of the model as it shows such a slight negative trend, that it is virtually irrelevant to acknowledge. The regression line at its peak shows a slight negative trend between 0.0006 and 0.0004. In reality, this shows there is no relationship between median household income and the percent of the democratic vote in the Midwest.This is the statistical equivalent of a complete non-factor.} 4.3.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree (Emily Pauline) Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct -0.754*** 0.049 (0.207) (0.190) Constant 62.423*** 44.051*** (3.240) (4.727) Observations 105 94 R2 0.115 0.001 Adjusted R2 0.106 -0.010 Residual Std.

For 1992, the coefficient for this model is -0.754, and it is also significant, given the number of asterisks next to it. A magnitude is close to -1 means that the percentage of people with a Bachelor’s Degree does have an impact on how people vote. This negative number indicates that as the percentage of people with a Bachelor’s Degree within an election year increases by 1%, the percentage of people that vote Democratic decreases by about 75%. The r-squared value of 0.11 indicates that for the region, this variable explains about 11% of the variance. This fairly strong relationship is also seen in the scatterplot. The overall trend line slopes down, further illustrating that the higher the percentage with a Bachelor’s Degree, the lower the percentage that vote Democratic. The model results in 2016 are a little different. The model coefficient this time is 0.049, and it is not significant. Even though this number is positive, it is very close to 0, meaning that the percentage of people with a Bachelor’s Degree has almost no role in determining the percent of the population that votes Democratic. The very small r-squared value of 0.001 also supports this. This very small value means that education level really didn’t impact how people voted in this election. This is also seen in the scatterplot. The trendline in this graph is very slightly positive, but almost completely flat. This indicates that there really isn’t a trend, or a relationship, to be defined through this model. 4.3.4 Multivariate models Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct -0.346 0.396* (0.286) (0.226) medhhinc -0.0002 -0.0002 (0.0002) (0.0002) nonwht_pct 0.350*** 0.521*** (0.062) (0.054) Constant 61.055*** 37.172*** (5.817) (6.574) Observations 105 94 R2 0.351 0.613 Adjusted R2 0.332 0.600 Residual Std.

In both 1992 and 2016, the percent non-white variable had the strongest impact on whether or not people voted Democratic in an election. In both years, the coefficient for percent non-white is positive, of moderate magnitude, and is significant. This indiates that as the percent of the population that is non-white increases, that particular district is more likely to vote Democratic in an election. The magnitude further helps to quantify the significance. In 2012, the magnitude of percent non-white was 0.35, and in 2016 it was 0.52. This indicates that as the percent of the population that is not white increases by 1%, the percent of the population that votes Democtatic increases by 35% and 52%, respectively. Within this model, the Median Household Income variable has essentially no impact on how Midwesterners vote. In both election years the coefficient was -0.0002. This negative, low magnitude, insignificant value means that there is really no relationship between Median Household Income and whether or not the district votes Democratic. The Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree variable has a magnitude of -0.346 in 1992. This value is negative and of moderate value, but the relationship is not significant. As the percent of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree increases by 1%, the percent that votes Democratic decreases by about 35%, indicating an impact of some kind on election results. However, this relationship, based on the model, is not a significant one. The opposite occurs in 2016. The magnitude in this model is 0.396; this time it is positive, of moderate value, and also significant, as denoted by the three asterisks next to the value. So, in 2016, the percent of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree also helped to explain election outcome. As the percentage with a Bachelor’s Degree increased, the percentage that voted Democratic increased by about 40%. The results from the multivariate regression model generally follow the same results as the univariate regression models. The univariate regression model with Median household income suggests that there is no relationship between household income and election outcome, and this was supported by the Multivariate Regression. The univariate model with percent non-white had a strong impact on the percent that voted Democratic, based on coefficients and r-squared values. Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree displayed the most interesting results, as on its own it went from having a significant impact on how people voted in 1990 to having an insignificant impact in 2016. However, when put into the multivariate regression, this model became slightly significant in 2016. This means that on its own in 2016, education level didn’t have a very strong impact on how people voted, but compared to other variables, it has value in determining election outcomes. When checking for multicollinearity, we ran a VIF test. The values after this test suggest that there isn’t really any multicollinearity with this model, since all of the values are less than 5. The only variable for concern would be household income in 2016, as it has a value of 4.02. After creating a correlation table, it does appear that median household income and percent with a Bachelor’s Degree are positively correlated, with a coefficient of 0.82. This relationship could help to explain some of the model results, like possibly why percent with a Bachelor’s Degree becomes significant in the multivariate regression model. To test for heterosketasticity, we ran a BP test and got a p-value of 0.06 in 1992 and 0.5 in 2016. Since these values are both greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that that residuals are not hetersketastic. This means that relationships between values are subject to change over time, and so the model outcome may not always be consistent. To further test the residuals, we made ridge plots and maps. The ridge plots show a fairly even distribution of residuals, although in 2015 it appears to be slightly positively skewed. From the map, there seem to be a few hotspots of residuals. In 1992 there are areas of high residual values in South Dakota, west-central Missouri, northwestern Wisconsin, and east-central Ohio. Low residual values are found in Nebraska, western Kansas, southern Missouri, northeastern Wisconsin, western Michigan, and western Ohio. These values seem to be fairly spread out, and all appear to cancel each other out, so it doesn’t seem like there is one area in particular that is causing problems. In 2016 there are there are high residual values in Minnesota, western Wisconsin, eastern Iowa, and northwestern Illinois. There are low residual values in North Dakota, Missouri, southern Kansas, and northeastern Indiana. Again, it appears that there are no significant outliers that would impact this model. In contrast to 1992, the outliers of residuals in 2016 appear to be more clustered together. For example, values of higher residuals appear to be concentrated in the area previously mentioned. In 1992 residual values appear to be more spread out. In general, there don’t appear to be any significant issues with this model. 4.4 Summary This analysis revealed several relationships regarding voting outcome in the Midwest. On its own, Median Household income appears to have had no impact on either election. The percent of the poulation that is not white had some impact in 1992, but it was a lot stronger in 2016. Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree had a fairly strong negative impact in 1992, but no impact in 2016. In the combined model, the variable that had the strongest impact on voting outcomes in both elections was the percent non-white variable; as the percent of the population that is non-white increased, so did the percent of the population that voted Democratic. Percent with a Bachelor’s Degree also displayed some amount of significance in 2016 when compared to other variables. As the percent of the population with a Bachelor’s Degree increased, the percent of the population that voted Democratic increased as well. In conclusion, the census data variable that has the largest impact on how Midwesterners vote is race. "],
["west.html", "Chapter 5 West 5.1 Overview 5.2 Descriptive analysis 5.3 Models 5.4 Summary", " Chapter 5 West 5.1 Overview Our U.S. census region is the West Region, home to legends such as Billy the Kid and Butch Cassidy. In our project we will be delving into a three variables and contrasting the political landscapes of districts between the republican party and democratic party within our region’s states. The variables we are examining are non-white, non-hispanic, percent with a bachelor’s degree and median household income. We will be investigating these as individual variables and then discuss any relationships that we notice between them should that be applicable. We will also analyze the influence of these variables and voting patterns to see if there are instances of gerrymandering. It is important to note that we are excluding Alaska and Hawaii because we were told to leave it out for cartographic reasons, even though we understand that they are geographically included in the West Region. The states that will be included in our project, that encompass the remaining West Region are: Washington, Wyoming, Montana, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. In regard to political affiliation between republican or democratic parties, the region as a whole appears to lean right in favor of conservative, republican representatives. This was surprising at first because of the left leaning trend along the Pacific coastal states. When we look at the breakdown of current districts within each state we can conclude which way the state leans on a partisan level. By using our district data we know how many districts are within each state and how voters voted in the 1992 and 2016 elections which allows us to conclude whether it is a democrat leaning or republican leaning state. For example, California has 53 districts and while both republicans and democrats are voted for across districts, largely the state leans left in favor of democrats. Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and Idaho lean right. Montana actually went from leaning right in 1992 to leaning left in the 2016 election. Similarily, Nevada changed from left leaning to right while New Mexico changed from right to left. Oregon, Washington, and finally Wymoning leans right. By looking at each individual state’s party vote percentages across districts for each year we are able to determine which way the state leans partisan wise and then which way the region as a whole tends to lean. Additionally we can compare the amount of districts for each state for the election year 1992 and election year 2016 to see if there were any changes. Our variables that we are researching for each year may contribute to changes and partisan shifts. In the year 1990 the district totals for each state were as follows: California has 52 districts, Washington has 9, Arizona has 6, Colorado has 6, Oregon has 5, New Mexico has 3, Utah has 3, Idaho has 2, and Nevada has 2. In 2015 the district totals for each state were as follows. California increased their total by 1 resulting in 53 districts. Washington also increased by 1 resulting in 10 districts. Arizona added 3 more for a total of 9 districts. Colorado added 1 district reaching a total of 7. Oregon experienced no changes in amount of districts remianing at a total of 5. Additionally, New Mexico remained at 3 districts with no amount changes. Utah added one district totaling 4. Idaho remained the same with a total of 2. Finally Nevada added 2 districts totaling 4. Wymoning has one at-large congressional district. 5.2 Descriptive analysis 5.2.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic In this graph we can find the percentage of non-white and non-Hispanic people in the years of 1990 and 2015 in the western region of the United States. In the graph of the year 1990, the average is in 30 percentage. In states like Washington, Utah, Oregon and Colorado, the non-white non-Hispanic population is between 5% and 20%. In the case of the New Mexico state, the percentage of population is around 40% or 45%. We can say that all these states have a tendency to stay in the same growth trend. The California states has around 90% of population nonwhite and non Hispanic. This shows a continuous growth trend for the future. The washigton state has a mesokurtic distribution because is neither high nor low, rather it is considered to be a baseline for the two other classifications. Utah, Oregon and New Mexico have a leptokurtic distribution. The Colorado State has a bimodal peak. Finally, we can say that California and Arizona have a Platykurtic distributions. On the other hand, In the graph of the year 2015, the average is in 40 percentage. We can see that states like Utah, Oregon and New Mexico maintain their trend since 1990. In the case of the state of Nevada (which data was not presented in the year 1990). shows one of the highest values of percentage of people not white and not hispanic, like the state of California. This growth trend may be due to the growth of the non-white or non-Hispanic population or to the decrease in the white and Hispanic population. talking about kurtosis, the Washington state has two peaks and the California states has a Platykurtic distribution. ## Reading layer `districts_all&#39; from data source `https://github.com/jshannon75/geog4300/raw/master/Labs/Final_assignment/districts_all.geojson&#39; using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 877 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -179.1489 ymin: -14.5487 xmax: 179.7785 ymax: 71.36516 ## epsg (SRID): 4326 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## Reading layer `USstates_48&#39; from data source `https://github.com/jshannon75/geog4300/raw/master/Labs/Final_assignment/USstates_48.geojson&#39; using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 48 features and 8 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -124.7328 ymin: 24.95638 xmax: -66.96927 ymax: 49.37173 ## epsg (SRID): 4326 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs The entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by European, Hispanic or Latino, Asian and Native Americans; it contains the largest number of minorities in the U.S. The West also contains much of the Native American population in the U.S., particularly in the large reservations in the Mountain and Desert States.These graphs shows the distribution by districts of the non-white and non-Hispanic population in the western territory of the United States, during the years 1990 and 2015. The map of the year 1990 indicates that there was a greater presence of non-white population and non-Hispanic in the state of New Mexico. However, in one of its districts in the center of this state shows a lower presence of this population. In some districts of southern Arizona and central California there is a high percentage of non-Hispanic non-white population. In the north of the West region, there is a low percentage of non-Hispanic non-white population. The population distribution by race in the Western United States (2010): 66.4% Non-Hispanic Whites, 28.6% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 9.3% Asian, 4.8% Black or African American, 1.9% American Indian or Alaska Native and 12.4% Some other race. In 2015 graphic, we can see that the concentration of the population has decreased but it has expanded throughout the territory. In the state of Arizona, a greater concentration of population can be observed in the south of this state. Likewise, the concentration of population has expanded in the central part of the state of California. The population has expanded to the state of Nevada and Colorado. Nevertheless, there are some states where this population don’t have incremented such as for instance Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon. We can conclude that the population has expanded significantly over the years. 5.2.2 Median household income Ridge plot analysis of the median household income variable in 1990 compared to 2015: According to the ridge plots produced above we can see that in 1990 the mean of median household income of the West Region was around 60,000 dollars. To the right of the median line (or incomes exceeding the median amount) you will notice that there are a few states that peak between the 60,000 and 75,000 dollar range and those data are shown to be more platykurtic and mesokurtic.These states are California, Colorado, and Washington. There are few states that extend beyond the 75,000 dollar mark California being one that trickles over and just grazes the 100,000 dollar line. The most prominent peaks of the ridegelines fall to the left of the median household income line, or people that make less than the mean median income. New Mexico, Utah, and Washington are the most significant with New Mexico’s population peaking around 35,000, Utah’s around 35,00 and Washington around 55,000, just under the median income line. Interestingly in the 2015 ridgeline plot, the average median household income is about the same hovering around 60,000, but the distribution amongst the states differs from what we saw in the 1990 data. We can also describe these data distributions more specifically with the terms platykurtic, mesokurtic and leptokurtic. For example when we look at the data in 2015 for the average median household income for New Mexico, they are very leptokurtic or thin on the ridgeline plot. For the 2015 ridgeline plots the range of incomes is greater than the 1990. By comparing the two we can see some prevalent shifts. For example, the amount of wealthier districts in the state of California decreased from 1990 to 2015. There was also a meadian household income shift in New Mexico from about 37,000 in 1990 to 41,000 in 2015. Colorado is another state that is interesting to compare from 1990 to 2015. In 1990 Colorado’s mean median household income fell below the average at around 40,000 whereas in 2015 it increased to exceeding the average at around 65,000. As a whole, we can see that there is more variation of income in the 2015 ridge plot. This seems to be consistent with the spatial representation in the tmaps. Tmap analysis of the medhhinc variable from 1990 to 2015: The tmaps above provide the data of household income spatially. You can see a distinct shift from 1990 to 2015 in the states of Colorado and Utah for example. In the 1990 map, Colorado appears to predominantly be the lightest shade signifying that the medhhinc range fell between 35,278 and 46,214 whereas in the 2015 map there are no districts in the state that remain that shade. Instead, about half the state shifts to bein a full shade darker with a range of 45,115 and 52,457 for the medhhinc variable. The other half the state is an even darker orange with a range that shifted to 61,296 and 70,534. Utah is really interesting because not only did the medhhinc increase statewide, but the districts flipped flopped in regard to frequency of wealthier incomes. In 1990 the west part of the state had significantly higher median household incomes, but in 2015 the east side of the state drastcially increased to surpass the west side’s 1990 medhhinc. By looking at the maps as whole it is evident that median household income on average increased across the entire region with few exceptions remaining in the same category. The western sliver of Idaho and the bulk of eastern Oregon are examples of these spots. Again, in the tmaps we are able to see the increase in variation of incomes from 1990 to 2015 for the whole of the West Region. 5.2.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree The following states were not included in the ridge plot for both 1990 and 2015: Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Hawaii, and Alaska. Additionally, Nevada was not graphed in 1990 but rather appears in 2015. I believe this was because these are the locations for which there was less than three congressional districts by which to compare, and hence we did not have a distribution to plot. Otherwise, the width of the distribution for all of the ridge plots increased between 1990 and 2015, which suggests that there is more variance as to the percentage of people with Bachelor’s degrees across the West U.S. Census Region. This shift is also reflected in how the average across the region increased. Additionally, the peaks of the ridges shifted to the right, also reflecting a general increase in the average level of educational attainment. The spatial distribution for the attainment of the Bachelor’s degrees shows a general increase across the region (which is also in the increase of the legend’s percentage brackets based upon quantile intervals), but it also appears to have hotspots which reflect areas of possible higher population, but even more so, areas where there are higher education. These key areas include major cities within states and the coastline, such as with Califoria. Also, there appears to be a lower percentage in areas with depleated populations. 5.3 Models (Include models for both years and scatterplots/fit lines. Interpret the coefficients and measures of model strength, focusing on direction, magnitude, and significance. Also look at the model residuals using density plots and maps as shown in the assignment.) 5.3.1 Percent not White, non-Hispanic Model results nonwht 1992 2016 (1) (2) nonwht_pct 0.230*** 0.352*** (0.059) (0.052) Constant 44.627*** 38.250*** (2.184) (2.727) Observations 90 99 R2 0.146 0.319 Adjusted R2 0.136 0.312 Residual Std.

The first and second columns of this data contain the population nonwhite and non-Hispanic and democratic votes. Let X denote total democratic votes and Y denote the population. In the graph of the year 1990 as the number of Democratic votes increases, the number of the population increases. In this same sense, for the year 2015 we see a similar scenario. In this graph, it can be seen that as the number of Democratic votes increases, the non-white and non-Hispanic population increase too, but it should be noted that it does increase significantly. No doubt this is because for the 2015 the non-white and non-mestizo population increased. Of course, we have to understand that the number of samples (population nonwhite-nonHispanic in 2015 is greater than 1990. Direction: Both, in the year 1990 and in the year 2015 the direction of the variable non-white and non-Hispanic population is positive. Which means an population increment. Significance: There is an important significance between 1990 and 2015, as we can see between its values (0.230 *** 0.352 ***) the difference goes between 0.122%. Another value that indicates an important significance is the p-value for the year 1990 is &lt;0.1 and for the year 2015 it is &lt;0.05. Magnitude: We can observe that for the year 1990 the population is dispersed, however there is a tendency of the points to be close to the line (average). For the year 2015, the population shows the same dynamics of the year 1900 although a little more dispersed. 5.3.2 Median household income Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) medhhinc -0.0002* 0.0001 (0.0001) (0.0001) Constant 61.049*** 47.115*** (5.901) (5.901) Observations 90 99 R2 0.033 0.017 Adjusted R2 0.022 0.007 Residual Std.

Direction: For the year 1990 the direction is negative, for 2015 the direction is positive Significance: For the 1992 model the medhhinc variable does have significance however it is not significant in the 2016 model. Scatterplot analysis: Magnitude: Like we saw in the 1992 regression model the 1990 scatterplot visually demonstrates the negative slope, showing that as our incomes increase, the democratic vote decreases. Likewise with our 2016 model, the 2015 scatterplot demonstrates that as our income increases the democratic vote also increases. Direction:1990 has a negative direction, 2015 has a positive direction Significance: In the 1990 scatterplot, there is a general directional trend of plots that supports the marginal significance of the medhinc variable we witnessed in the regression model, however in the 2015 scatterplot the plots are pretty dispersed indicating that there is not significance. 5.3.3 Percent with a bachelor’s degree Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct -0.048 0.211* (0.176) (0.119) Constant 52.081*** 48.494*** (3.717) (3.665) Observations 90 99 R2 0.001 0.032 Adjusted R2 -0.011 0.022 Residual Std.

This is also supported by the F Statistic, in that it was insigificant, and therefore did not matter to the model that the percentage of people with Bachelor’s degrees was unimportant to how people voted democratically. However, in the 2016 election, there was some significance observed and between the percentage of people with Bachelor’s degrees and how they voted democratically. The relationship was positive (meaning that as the percentage of people with Bachelor’s degrees increased then the number of people who voted democratically also increased). The magnitude of the relationship, albeit still small (coefficient = 0.211) was deemed to be sigificant (0.5 &lt; p &lt; 0.1). Also, the F statistic was sigificant (0.5 &lt; p &lt; 0.1), meaning that it did make a sigificant difference to the model that the percent of people with Bachelor’s degrees trended with the percentage of people who voted democratically. Both of these models are depicted in the scatter plots above. 5.3.4 Multivariate models Model results Pct. voting democratic 1992 2016 (1) (2) badeg_pct 0.667*** 0.712*** (0.228) (0.149) medhhinc -0.0004*** -0.0002* (0.0001) (0.0001) nonwht_pct 0.281*** 0.455*** (0.060) (0.049) Constant 52.810*** 26.376*** (5.695) (5.127) Observations 90 99 R2 0.242 0.490 Adjusted R2 0.216 0.474 Residual Std.

We can also see that our data is normal. 1992 Regression Model: The direction of the regression model for the badeg_pct and the nonwht_pct variables are both positive, however for the medhhinc variable it is actually negative. The significance of each variable in the 1992 model is significant. The coefficients for the badeg_pct and the nonwht_pct are higher than the medhhinc however because the medhhinc’s coefficient translates to 10% of 10,000 dollars of household incomes, which is a significant amount, we can conclude that the magnitude of all of the variables is high. 2016 Regression Model: Similarily to the 1992 model, the direction of the badeg_pct and the nonwht_pct variables are positive while the medhhinc variable is negative. Again, like in our 1992 model the significance of all of our variables are significant. Looking at our coefficients for each variable we can also determine that the magnitude in this model for each is high. Significant problems: We do have a few outliers evident. Spatially we can see that the outliers appear to be along the coast. With regard to heterosketasticity we fail to reject the null hypotheses because we do not have heterosketasticity evident based on our bptest. We also do not have multicolinearity in our viff test because each variable for each year is less than 4. 5.4 Summary There are many similarities between percent of non white and non hispanic population and Percent with a bachelor’s degree and Median household income. For example in New Mexico and Arizona, both in 1990 and 2015 years the states which have a high non white non hispanic population have a low percent bachelor’s degree. On the other hand, the median household income is very related with the non white and non hispanic population because in states where there are low incomes (such as New Mexico) where there is a high Percent not White, non-Hispanic population. We can conclude that poverty goes hand in hand with the low level of education and that it is usually present in states where the white population (mainly) and the Hispanic population is low, maybe related to other demographic categories.

Percent not white, non-hispanic was by far the most consistent behavior of voting behavior, with large and positive coefficients in both 1992 and 2016. In all regions, the magnitude and power of this variable increased from 1992 to 2016. In many cases, this one variable had an R2 of 0.5 or higher, explaining the majority of variation in partisan voting. Other variables were also significant, though these varied by year and region. In the West region, for example, percentage with a Bachelor’s degree had a higher coefficient than our race variable in both years, but this variable was also much smaller in a univariate model, indicating potential interaction between education and race within this region. In other regions, higher education rates were positively predictive in 2016, but not in 1992. Household income was the least consistent variable, significant in roughly the half the models and varying between positive (South) and negative (Midwest, West, Northeast) dependening on the region. 6.1.1 Comparison to national models Running the same multivariate models at the national level (see figure below) shows similar paterns to the regional models. Percentage non-white is significant and positive in both years, but the magnitude of the coefficient is larger for the 2016 election (0.30 vs. 0.46). Nationally, this means that an increase of 1% in the non-white population is associated with a 1/3 to 1/2 point increase in the Democratic vote. Median household income is also significant and negative in these national models, which is consistent in most regional models. The coefficient here is slightly smaller in 2016, but the two are similar: the Democratic share of the vote decreases by 1% for each $4,000 in additional median household income. Lastly, a bachelor’s degree or higher is also strongly and positively predictive of Democratic votes at the national level (0.67 in 1992, 0.73 in 2016), which differs somewhat from the inconsistent results in regional models. In both elections, increased education was strongly associated with more liberal voting patterns. As was the case in regional models, our variables explained significantly more of the variance in 2016 (R2=0.50) than in 1992 (R2=0.27), but both have at least some explanatory power.

Many of our variables were not normally distributed, and this may have accounted for heteroskedasticity in our multivariate models as well as a few instances where residuals were either not statistically normal or spatially clustered. More complex modelling approaches, such as transforming variables or including interaction effects, may have produced models with more explanatory power. In addition, we use only two years in this analysis, and this may affect our results. The election in 1992 resulted in a Democratic president while in 2016, Republicans took all three elected bodies at the federal level. Analysis that included additional years that produced less definitive results would potentially provide more insight into the changing electorate. In addition, this project looks only at voting for U.S. House seats, and votes for other voting geographies (state legislatures, for example) or at other scales such as counties might tell a different story. Our analysis also is done at the district level, and so we cannot account for the ways that changing patterns of redistricting, including partisan or racial gerrymandering, might affect the demographic patterns identified in these districts. 6.3 Final thoughts Our models show that the demographic variables we used in this study are more powerful as predictors of partisan voting in 2016 than in 1992. Race, operationalized as percentage classified as non-white, was the most consistent predictor in these models, positively associated with the Democratic vote in both time periods and nearly twice as strong 2016 as in 1992. These models suggest increasing racialization in partisan voting patterns over the last two decades. They also correspond with concerns about the growing influence of white nationalism among some conservative voters. Income and education are also significant predictors of voting behavior in many models. In most cases, voting becomes more conservative as median household income rises, but this is mediated somewhat by a contasting effect from higher levels of education. A more sophisticated modelling approach might better frame the relationship between these variables and understand their regional variation. Through this project, our class was able to use descriptive and basic statistical methods using the R software package to explore these voting patterns. We hope that future courses might borrow from this model and make further contributions to understanding in this area. "]
